Wonderlands Hotfix Archive
==========================

This is an archive of the hotfixes which are being sent to Tiny Tina's Wonderlands.
They were first collected on March 24, right around the official release
date for the PC version, and have been collected automatically ever
since that point.

The hotfixes are written twice: once to a brand-new file which includes
a datestamp, stored in the `point_in_time` directory, and once to
`hotfixes_current.json`.

The script which does this is written in Python 3, and should run anywhere
Python does, though you'll need to edit `output_dir` inside the script
itself to have it save out files properly.  Check `requirements.txt` inside
the script dir for the extra Python modules needed for it to run.

=======

apocalyptech, the person who's historically maintained a list of patch
details about Borderlands 3, is waiting for the Steam release before
buying Wonderlands, so he won't be maintaining such a list for this game,
at least for some time.  If anyone else is interested in maintaining
a list, let us know!
